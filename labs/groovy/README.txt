Test first!

Create a Groovy class named GroovyOrderItem that
implements OrderItem.

Rewrite Order in Groovy as GroovyOrder.

Add an import method to GroovyOrder that reads in
an XML file:

<orders>
  <orderitem cost="15">Pizza</orderitem>
  <orderitem cost="5">Soda</orderitem>
  <orderitem cost="10">Breadsticks</orderitem>
</orders>

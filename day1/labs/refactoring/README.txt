Lab #2 - Refactoring

Extract topping into a Topping class.

Create a StandardToppings class.

Fix the abomination that is the Order class.
(Hint: use BigDecimal for tax and total)

Now add an expected duration for the order
- Our oven can bake up to 5 pizzas at once
(for the sake of simplicity, we work on one order at a time...)
- Larges take 30 minutes, Mediums 25, Smalls 15
- For each non-standard topping, add 2 minutes

## Java Tools
* [EasyMock](http://www.easymock.org/) is a popular mock object framework for Java. The [2.4 README](http://www.easymock.org/EasyMock2_4_Documentation.html) is a good introduction to key features.
* [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/) was built to address limitations in JUnit. It is much more feature-rich. When you are just getting started, this won't matter much, but as your test suite becomes larger TestNG's advanced features have more impact.

## Additional Reading
* [Don't Call Super](http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000077.html) is a short rant on the difficulty of reusing code across JUnit test cases. Inheritance more than one-deep from TestCase is fragile and error-prone.
* [Using annotation inheritance for testing](http://www.beust.com/weblog/archives/000170.html) explains why you might want to explicitly state dependencies between tests, and how to do it in TestNG.
